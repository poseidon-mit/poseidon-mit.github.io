--- Slide 1 ---
Notes: Poseidon.AI is our trusted AI-native money platform. Today I will walk through the four engines and show how they operate as one system. → Next: The Coordination Gap

--- Slide 2 ---
Notes: The hidden coordination tax is real: around $133 per month in user loss, $12.5B annual fraud loss, and major overdraft burden. Mint proved visibility alone is not enough. Users still act as the integrator. → Next: Why Now

--- Slide 3 ---
Notes: Three forces converge now: open banking standards, AI economics improving, and user expectations shifting to proactive guidance. 2025 is the window for AI-native financial services. → Next: The Architecture

--- Slide 4 ---
Notes: Our architecture is a closed loop: Protect, Grow, Execute, Govern. Each engine has a clear role, and together they deliver auditable decisions, not isolated insights. → Next: Differentiation

--- Slide 5 ---
Notes: We match baseline fintech features, then differentiate on five critical capabilities, especially governance-by-design. That governance moat is difficult to replicate. → Next: Roadmap

--- Slide 6 ---
Notes: Execution is phased across four stages. We track hard gates like 9K users, 70% precision, and 99.9% uptime to prove break-even and operational readiness. → Next: Unit Economics

--- Slide 7 ---
Notes: Unit economics justify the business: 17x–77x value-to-cost ratio, blended CAC under $10, and 87% gross margin at scale. Operating break-even at Month 15 on $25M total capital, with Series A triggered at $300K MRR in Month 9. By Month 36: 2.2M monthly users, 717K paid, $96M annual revenue. → Next: Live Demo

--- Slide 8 ---
Notes: The demo follows a 30-second journey: unified dashboard, Protect with explainability, Execute with human approval, and Govern with audit logging. → Next: Closing

--- Slide 9 ---
Notes: The strategy rests on three pillars: governance, architecture, and business model. Economics target about $640 yearly user savings, 87% margin, and roughly 6x value-to-cost. → Next: Team + QR Code

--- Slide 10 ---
Notes: We close with the team and operating principle: deterministic compute, explainable AI, and explicit human approval before action. The QR code links to the live demo. → Next: Financial Appendix

Notes: Appendix: supporting assumptions, references, and calculation details for diligence review.
